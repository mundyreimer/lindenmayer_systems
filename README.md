## Setup

### 1) Installing dependencies:

If using venv, create a virtual environment named `venv_linden` using:
`python3 -m venv venv_linden`

Activate the environment: 
`source venv_linden/bin/activate`

Then, install the necessary packages: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2) Troubleshooting:
